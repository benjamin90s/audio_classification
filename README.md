# Environmental Sound Classification with Deep Learning
# Problem Statement

This project demonstrates how to apply deep learning techniques to classify environmental sounds, with a focus on identifying specific urban sounds. Given an audio sample in a computer-readable format (such as a .wav file) of a few seconds duration, the goal is to determine if it contains one of the target urban sounds and evaluate the classification accuracy.
